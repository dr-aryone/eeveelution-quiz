    'description': "You're a very well-rounded and open-minded person, willing to hear new perspectives and not limit yourself to a set path. Like Eevee itself, the future has many possibilities! Take advantage of this and be as adventurous as possible, and remember to take some risks! However, you likely have a habit of being indecisive or naive at important moments. Don't be afraid to stand up for your beliefs and put your foot down. As your identity gets clearer to you, be willing to fight for who you are."

    'name': 'vaporeon',
    'type': 'water',
    'description': "You have a very flexible personality that can easily roll with the punches and rarely get caught off guard. If things don't go according to plan, you'll yell 'Plot Twist!' and keep going. This gives you many different sides to your personality, but be careful. You have a tendency to be inconsistent with your goals, so have some more self-discipline! Don't let the people or circumstances around you control you too much. Otherwise it'll be hard to get what you want in life."

    'type': 'electric',
    'description': "You have no shortage of energy, as life is a race and you're charging ahead at full speed! When you're excited you have plenty of enthusiasm, which energizes everyone around you. But keep in mind while you're great at doing things short-term, you need to remember the bigger picture too. Don't forget to slow down, pay attention to the details, and make some long-term goals. Otherwise all your energy will burn out far too fast!"

    'name': 'flareon',
    'type': 'fire',
    'description': "You rarely let anyone or anything hold you back, as the world is your playground and you're enjoying the games a lot. What's important is seeing the world and finding new experiences. Chances are you have either great stories to share or ambitious plans to put together. However, it's easy to get carried away and wind up lost in the woods of life. Adventure is good, but don't cross the line into aimless wandering where you don't know where to go next. Try to take a more mature approach to life, set a couple limits, and have some 'serious' time every week."

    'name': 'espeon',
    'type': 'psychic',
    'description': "You're a major intellectual, almost always looking to learn more about the world, your passions, and anything interesting. It's very hard for others to fool you, or for important details to slip past you. Curiousity and self-motivation drive you to keep learning. But don't let your relentless pursuit of knowledge keep you from other experiences. Put that knowledge to use every now and then and pursue unfamiliar experiences. Don't worry if you're nervous - no matter what happens, you can think of a way to handle it."
  }, {
    'name': 'umbreon',
    'type': 'dark',
    'description': "You're a a very private person, with lots of secrets and a complex mind. You're fine operating alone and can handle almost any situation yourself - even when most people couldn't. Take advantage of this and push yourself to your limits whenever possible! However, just because you feel okay living life alone doesn't mean you always should. You can easily get too withdrawn from others and feel lonely. Try to put yourself out there more so you can have more friends nearby for your next adventure."
  }, {
    'name': 'leafeon',
    'type': 'grass',
    'description': "You're very conscious of what's around you, both environmentally and in general. You spot details most people would glaze over, helping you be more resourceful and practical. Chances are you've got great survival skills, and can do a lot more with a lot less. Plus you try to leave your planet at least as healthy as when you arrived. Just don't get too caught up in what's already around you. Unleash your creativity and do some inventing. Add to this world as well as keeping it healthy!"
  }, {
    'name': 'glaceon',
    'type': 'ice',
    'description': "You're a very composed and 'in-control' person that's hard to throw off balance. While there's almost always a way to get under someone's skin, that rarely happens to you. You know what you want, where you're going, and have all your priorities where they should be. But while you have a good head on your shoulders, don't get stuck in your mind for too long. Otherwise you'll drift away from what's around you, getting cynical or mean-spirited in the process. So be sure how you deal with others is as consistent and healthy as how you deal with yourself."
  }, {
    'name': 'sylveon',
    'type': 'fairy',
    'description': "People likely smile the second they see you from your memories with each other. Helping others, friends and strangers, are high priorities as you try and help others as much as possible. You'll likely make a difference in many people's lives, and brighten up their days too. While you make the world better for many others, obviously you can't forget your happiness either. Make some 'me time' a priority, since it'll be hard for you to keep helping others if you fizzle out. After all, others care for your happiness as much as you care for theirs. Don't let them down!"
